    <h1>Tuples</h1>

    <pre>
        <b>Tuple</b> is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, 
        and they are indexed by integers. 

        Values of a tuple are syntactically separated by ‘commas’. Although it is not necessary, it is more common to define a tuple 
        by closing the sequence of values in parentheses. This helps in understanding the Python tuples more easily.

    <h3>Creating a Tuple</h3>
    <pre>
        In Python, tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for 
        grouping the data sequence.

        <b>Note:</b> Creation of Python tuple without the use of parentheses is known as Tuple Packing.

    <h3>Python program to demonstrate the addition of elements in a Tuple.</h3>
    <pre>
        Tuple1 = ()
        print("Initial empty Tuple: ")
        print(Tuple1)
        Tuple1 = ('Geeks', 'For')
        print("\nTuple with the use of String: ")
        print(Tuple1)
        list1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
        print("\nTuple using List: ")
        print(tuple(list1))
        Tuple1 = tuple('Geeks')
        print("\nTuple with the use of function: ")
        print(Tuple1)
