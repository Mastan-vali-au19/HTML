        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <b> HTML </b> stands for <i> Hyper Text Markup Language </i>, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. 
        HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. 
        <u> HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999</u>. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are 
        having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
